Damage

This article needs cleanup to meet quality standards.

Please help improve this article if you can.

Damage is the process by which a player or monster's life or energy shield is reduced.

This page focuses on damage being dealt by the player. For information on damage dealt by minions, see Minion. For information on how elemental damage affects the player, see status ailments and resistances. For information on when damage is applied see, receiving damage.

Damage calculation
The basic damage calculation is:

Damage = (Base_Damage + Added_Damage) * Increased_Damage * More_Damage * Hit_Rate * (Critical_Strike_Damage * Critical_Strike_Chance)
Base_Damage: The primary damage of the skill. This is either specified in the skill itself (and increases with the level of the skill gem), or is determined by the damage of your weapon (in the case of most Attacks).
Added_Damage: Additional flat damage applied, modified by the skill's damage effectiveness value.
Increased_Damage: Additional percentage damage applied. All applicable sources of increased damage stack additively (e.g. two +10% increased damage modifiers add together to make 20% increased damage: 100% + 10% + 10% = 120%).
More_Damage: Additional percentage damage applied. All unique sources of more damage are multiplicative with each other (e.g. two +10% more damage modifiers will multiply on top of each other: 110% * 110% = 121%).
Hit_Rate: The rate at which the damage is applied, typically based on attack speed or cast speed.
Critical_Strike_Damage: See Critical Strike Multiplier.
Critical_Strike_Chance: See Critical Strike Chance.
In general:, More Damage is usually more effective than Increased Damage, due to diminishing returns from stacking increased damage modifiers, and the multiplicative nature of More Damage modifiers.

Damage variance
Damage variance describes the difference between the highest possible value that a source of damage can roll and the lowest possible value. Sources with higher differences are described as having higher damage variance, with lightning damage being characterized as having the highest damage variance of all damage types. For example, Adds 190 to 220 Cold Damage is an example of a source with low damage variance, while Adds 1 to 1000 Lightning Damage would be an example of a source with high damage variance. Mechanics like Damage is Lucky works favourably with skills with high damage variance.

The damage number rolled is rolled per hit, and not per skill use, unlike crits.

Some sources of damage are characterized by a lack of damage variance. For example, 

Bloodthirst Support
's Supported Attacks deal Added Physical Damage with Weapons equal to 2% of Maximum Life while on Low Life is a static source of damage. This may be useful for players seeking to test in-game damage values while eliminating the uncertainty of damage rolls.

Damage source
All sources of damage are encompassed by one of four categories:[1]

Attack damage
Spell damage
Secondary damage
Damage over time
A single hit or instance of damage can only be one of these four categories at a time and are mutually exclusive. Modifiers which apply specifically to one damage source never innately apply to any others, though some skill modifiers allow the numeric values of one damage source to be used in calculations for another (e.g. 

Vortex
 - note that in this example, the damage over time component is still not considered dealing spell damage, and will not be affected by modifiers to spell damage taken, such as Unnerve). Generic modifiers (e.g. Elemental Damage or simply just "Damage") can affect multiple damage sources.

Damage type
A hit can be composed of several types of damage, but each damage type is calculated separately, including damage range rolls. Currently there are five types of damage:

Physical damage - Considered the default damage type. Auto-attacks typically deal physical damage before conversion, and almost all weapons (and unarmed) have base physical damage. Physical damage over time can be inflicted with the bleed ailment, or another common debuff, Corrupted Blood.
Fire damage - One of three elemental damage types. Dealing a critical strike with fire damage inflicts ignite, however ignites also occur based on chance to ignite. Fire damage over time from ignites, burning ground, or other sources is classified as burning damage.
Cold damage - One of three elemental damage types. Hitting an enemy with cold damage can inflict the chill ailment, while dealing a critical strike with cold damage can inflict freeze. Cold damage over time can be inflicted by certain spells, typically also applying Chill.
Lightning damage - One of three elemental damage types. Dealing a critical strike with lightning damage can inflict shock. Base lightning damage tends to have higher variability in damage ranges, with minimum and maximum damage values often being significantly further apart than similar fire or cold damage modifiers. Lightning damage over time is significantly less common than its counterparts, mostly limited to the Siphoning monster modifier, Shock and Horror's beam skill, The Shaper's beam, and some environmental hazards.
Chaos damage - Considered the rarest damage type, chaos damage bypasses energy shield and damages life directly. Chaos damage has the benefit of not being reflectable. Chaos damage over time can be inflicted with the poison ailment. Many chaos skills also innately cause debuffs that deal chaos damage over time.
Darkness is a non-standard damage type only used by the Darkness debuff in Delve's Azurite Mine, never by enemies (or players).[2] It can be mitigated by "darkness resistance" purchased at the Voltaxic Generator, as well as by generic modifiers to damage taken.

Keywords exclusive to damage sources
Some keywords are exclusive to a specific damage source.

Attack
Melee
Melee damage is a category of damage exclusive to the attack damage source; in the case of damage instances who inherit keywords from a parent skill (such as ignite or Puncture's bleed) the melee keyword is not inherited.

Unarmed
Main article: Unarmed
Unarmed damage is a subcategory of Melee Damage and therefore inherits damage modifiers from the Melee and Attack keywords.

Weapon-specific keywords
Weapon-specific keywords are derivatives of the Attack damage source and therefore are not inherited by damage instances who inherit keywords from a parent skill (such as ignite, puncture's bleed, or Caustic Arrow's caustic ground).

Other keywords
Beyond source and type, there are several other ways to classify damage which are best referred to by their generic name Keywords. In the case of a damage instance triggered by a parent skill (such as ignite), these modifiers are all inherited from the triggering hit. See keywords for more information.

Area
Certain skills have an Area of Effect (AoE for short) and can affect multiple enemies or allies at once.

Elemental
Elemental Damage modifiers affect all types of elemental damage (Fire, Cold and Lightning). Chaos damage is not considered elemental.

Mine
Mines are skills which are thrown (like Traps) and detonated by a separate command.

Minion
"Minion Damage" redirects here. For the support gem, see Minion Damage Support.
Modifiers to minion damage function as a generic damage modifier granted to the minion. This means it will apply to all damage dealt regardless of source, type, or keywords.

Projectile
Note that skills with the bow keyword are considered to implicitly be projectiles.

Totem
Modifiers to totem damage function as a generic damage modifier granted to the totem. This means it will apply to all damage dealt regardless of source, type, or keywords.

Trap
Modifiers to trap damage function as a generic damage modifier granted to the trap. This means it will apply to all damage dealt regardless of source, type, or keywords.

Generic modifiers
Damage modifiers that have no restrictions or specifications are commonly referred to as generic damage modifiers. These modifiers are potent since they will apply to all damage dealt by the modified skill regardless of source, type, or keywords.

Reflected damage
Main article: Damage reflection
Damage reduction
Damage reduction only affects physical damage. The other four damage types each have their own resistance value.
